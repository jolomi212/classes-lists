Zuri I4G Python class tasks

HELLO.
If you're reading this, then you're most likely a mentor, here to assess and grade my work.
I have made a list of the tasks uploaded here, till date, and where to find them in this repository

- Classes and Objects - "classes-objects.py"
- Finding Anagrams - "anagrams.py"
- Reading textfiles - It's in the directory "readfile", which has "main.py" as the python file, and "story.txt" as the text file being read.


I hope this has been of some help.
Thank you.
